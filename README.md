🔍 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts whether an individual's salary is more or less than $50,000 per year using demographic and work-related data. Built using a LightGBM classifier, the model analyzes features such as education, occupation, hours worked per week, and more. A user-friendly Streamlit web app is also included for real-time salary prediction.
